1 - [Introduction to Data Science With Python](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/applied-data-science-with-python/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20in%20Python)
  * Week+1.ipynb - Basic Python functions, CSV files handling and NumPy examples.
  * Week+2.ipynb - Pandas codes, including series, querying series, dataframes and introduction to missing values.
  * Week+3.ipynb - More Pandas codes, including the concept of Pandorable code, groupby, scales, pivot tables and working with date and time.
  * Week+4.ipynb - Distributions in Pandas and hypothesis testing.
  * Assignment+2.ipynb - It's the second week's assignment. It's an introduction to Pandas, using the concepts introduced in the Week+2.ipynb notebook.
  * Assignment+3.ipynb - It's the third week's assignment. It uses the concepts introduced in the Week+3.ipynb notebook and the indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the United Nations for the year 2013 as the data (avaiable in [this link](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/excel_file_tables/2013/Energy%20Indicators.xls), from the United Nations Statistics Division). It also uses the countries's GDP from 1960 to 2015 from World Bank (avaible [here](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)) and the Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology (avaible [here](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?category=2102)).
  * Assignment+4.ipynb - It's the forth week's assignment. It uses all the concepts about Pandas introduced (and requires some more), it also uses the housing data for the United States (from the [Zillow research data site](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)), the university towns in the United States data (copy and pasted from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States)) and the GDP over time of the United States (from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, avaiable [here](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp)).
